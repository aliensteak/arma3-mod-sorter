# ArmA 3 Mod Sorter
Helps you clean up all the mods from unused modpacks and keep only the mods you use. Most of the time, same mods exist in multiple modpacks which makes it difficult to remove mods manually. This script applies set operations to filter out all the mods you can unsubscribe.

1. Save all your mod presets which you want to keep. (ArmA 3 Launcer > Mods > Preset > Share)
3. Export a preset with all the mods. Note: The name of the modsets do not matter. (ArmA 3 Launcher > Mods > More > Export list of mods to file > All Mods)
4. Run `main.exe`.
5. Use `Add Modlist` to add all the previously exported modlists at once.
6. Use `Process` to process those files and get a list of mods which can be removed.
7. (optional) Use `Save` to save the list to a text file.
